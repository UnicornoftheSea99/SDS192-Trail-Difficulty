## Introduction

> READ THE INSTRUCTIONS: https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/mod_spatial.html

Biking from Smith College to MacLeish is of interest to a subset of field station visitors. Considering that some bikers appreciate climbing hills and others wish to avoid hills, propose two alternative bike routes to the field station using the available data from MassGIS. Detail the lengths of the routes and the elevation change along the routes, and support your choices with data. It would be cool if you could create elevation profiles (e.g., this one) for each bike route.
Supporting data includes:
- Road shapefiles (retrieve from MassGIS)
- 30â€™ contour elevation data (elevation)
- Property boundary layer (boundary)


## Loading the data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(macleish)
names(macleish_layers)
```

```{r}
points_of_interest <- tribble(
  ~name, ~lat, ~long,
  "Group Campsite", 42.450976, -72.678154, 
  "Remote campsite", 42.458549, -72.679581,
  "Parking", 42.448013, -72.680663,
  "Weather Station OrchardMet", 42.449653, -72.680315,
  "Weather Station WhatelyMet", 42.448470, -72.680553
) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
  st_set_crs(4326)
```

```{r}
trails <- mass_gis("dcrtrails")

boundary <- macleish_layers %>%
  pluck("boundary")

elevations <- macleish_layers %>%
  pluck("elevation")
```

```{r}
locations <- tribble(
  ~place, ~address, 
  "Smith", "44 College Lane, Northampton, MA 01063",
  "Macleish", "30, 78 Poplar Hill Rd, South Deerfield, MA 01373"
  
) %>%
  #geocoding
  geocode(address, method = "osm") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
  st_set_crs(4326)

#maclongitude="-72.68171351473106"
#maclatitude="42.45467547936159"
#macleish <- tibble(place = "Macleish", #geometry="-72.68171351473106,42.45467547936159"
#geometry=st_sfc(st_point(c(42.45467547936159,-72.68171351473106)))
#)

#locations <- locations %>% 
#  inner_join(macleish, by = c("geometry"="geometry"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#location of macleish
mac <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng =  -72.68171351473106,
    lat = 42.45467547936159,
    popup = "Macleish"
  )
mac
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#might use to find flat/hilly path (50 is flattest/easiest)
#use summarize?
rating = sqrt(2 x gain x distance)

#finds elevation for trail in question. probably use to apply to flat/hilly trails found from equation above and make elevation profile
trail_elevations <- longest_trail %>%
  st_intersection(elevations) %>%
  st_cast("MULTIPOINT") %>%
  st_cast("POINT")
```



## Static maps

You can make a basic static map with **ggplot2** using `geom_sf()`, as shown in the figure below.

```{r static, fig.cap="The boundary of the MacLeish property.",eval=FALSE}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = boundary) +
  geom_sf(data = elevations)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#example we can reference
boundary_plot +
  geom_sf(data = elevations, color = "dark gray") + 
  geom_sf(data = longest_trail, color = "brown", size = 1.5) + 
  geom_sf(data = trail_elevations, fill = "yellow", pch = 21, size = 3) + 
  geom_sf_label(
    data = trail_elevations, 
    aes(label = CONTOUR_FT), 
    hjust = "right", 
    size = 2.5,
    nudge_x = -0.0005
  )
```


## Dynamic maps

You can make a basic dynamic map with **leaflet**, as shown in the figure below.

```{r dynamic, fig.cap="The boundary of the MacLeish property.",eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data = boundary)
```



## Word count

```{r word_count, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
text_stats()
```
